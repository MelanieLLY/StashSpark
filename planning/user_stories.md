# User Stories — StashSpark

## Outline User Roles

- **User** — a registered individual who saves, organizes, and reviews their bookmarked content.  
- **Admin** *(optional / future)* — manages system-level configurations or reviews API usage (not needed for MVP).

## Draft User Stories

1. As a **user**, I want to **add a new bookmark by pasting a URL**, so that **I can quickly save something I want to read later**.  
2. As a **user**, I want to **automatically capture the title and domain from the URL**, so that **I don’t have to manually enter those details**.  
3. As a **user**, I want to **view all my saved bookmarks in a single dashboard**, so that **I can easily find what I’ve saved**.  
4. As a **user**, I want to **search my bookmarks by title or note content**, so that **I can locate specific items faster**.  
5. As a **user**, I want to **edit or delete bookmarks**, so that **I can keep my collection clean and organized**.  
6. As a **user**, I want to **write personal notes under each bookmark**, so that **I can record insights or reminders about what I read**.  
7. As a **user**, I want to **generate an AI summary of a bookmarked article**, so that **I can quickly recall the main ideas without re-reading it**.  
8. As a **user**, I want to **mark an item as “review later”**, so that **I can revisit important content at scheduled intervals**.  
9. As a **user**, I want to **see a list of items due for review today**, so that **I stay consistent with my learning routine**.  
10. As a **user**, I want to **organize bookmarks with optional tags or categories**, so that **I can group related topics when needed**.  
11. As a **user**, I want to **toggle between “inbox” (unprocessed) and “done” (reviewed)** states, so that **I can track my progress visually**.  
12. As a **user**, I want to **log in securely and access only my own saved items**, so that **my data stays private and personal**.
