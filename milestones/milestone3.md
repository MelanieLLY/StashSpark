## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

I successfully created our GitHub Project Board and planned out the core features for StashSpark. I learned how to organize issues and milestones and started building the basic app structure.


### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

It was challenging to decide how to split features into separate issues and understand GitHub’s project workflow at first. Also, I had to simplify some technical parts to keep progress steady.


### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

No — but most setup tasks are done. Most features (like notes and search) are still pending for the next milestone.


### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The AI summary and review features are at risk because they require API integration. I plan to use my personal chatgpt account credits.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

All instructions and help are already very good.
