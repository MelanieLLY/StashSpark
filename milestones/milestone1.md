## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

I clarified my app concept early and refined it into something achievable — a personal bookmarking and knowledge organization app that helps turn saved content into insights. I was able to design the basic data model, outline realistic features, and stay consistent with the full-stack scope of the course. The planning docs (user stories, feature list, and ERD) came together smoothly after choosing a focused use case.


### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

As a solo developer, the main challenge was narrowing the feature scope. I had a lot of ambitious ideas like AI summarization and spaced-review reminders, but I had to prioritize what’s doable in a few weeks. Balancing creativity and feasibility was tricky, and it took a few iterations to land on a clear MVP that still felt meaningful and fun to build.


### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I’ll need some guidance on integrating external APIs later (for auto-summary features), managing environment variables in Render, and setting up a clean database schema migration workflow. It would also help to get feedback on the wireframes and data flow before starting development, to make sure I’m not overcomplicating the logic.
