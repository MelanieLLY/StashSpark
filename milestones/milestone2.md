# Milestone 2 — StashSpark

This document was completed during **Unit 6** as part of the second milestone for the final project.



## Checklist

This unit, be sure to complete all tasks listed below. To complete a task, place an `x` between the brackets.

- [x] In `planning/wireframes.md`: add wireframes for at least three pages in your web app.  
  - [x] Include a list of pages in your app  
    - Dashboard (Inbox)  
    - Item Detail Page  
    - Review Today Page  
    - *(optional)* Settings / Login Page  
- [x] In `planning/entity_relationship_diagram.md`: add the entity relationship diagram you developed for your database.  
  - [x] Your entity relationship diagram should include the tables in your database (User, Item, Note, Summary, ReviewPlan, optional Tag, ItemTag).  
- [x] Prepare your three-minute pitch presentation, to be presented during Unit 7 (the next unit).  
  - [x] You do **not** need to submit any materials in advance of your pitch.  
- [x] In this document, complete all three questions in the **Reflection** section below  



## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

This unit was productive because I finalized the structure and flow of my app. I designed clear wireframes for the main pages — the Dashboard, Item Detail, and Review screens — and refined the data model with a modular Tag system that can be toggled on or off later. The ERD came together smoothly, and it feels scalable yet lightweight. The three-minute pitch deck also helped me tighten the story around StashSpark’s purpose: turning messy bookmarks into meaningful learning moments.



### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The main challenge was simplifying the design without losing core functionality. At first, I tried to include too many features like social sharing and browser extensions, but that made the scope too big. I also had to rework how the AI summary and review logic fit into the database so they didn’t overcomplicate the MVP. Balancing ambition and practicality was tricky, but creating a clean ERD and feature priority list helped.



### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I’ll need some guidance on connecting the database to the backend efficiently and structuring my API routes for future expandability (like adding AI or semantic search later). Help with deployment best practices on Render — especially handling environment variables and database migrations — would also be useful. Finally, feedback on my pitch delivery and wireframe usability would help make the project presentation smoother.
